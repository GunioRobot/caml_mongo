I am slowly writing an OCaml driver for MongoDB, mainly as
a learning experience. Any feedback is appreciated, and the 
code is in the Public Domain.

Right now, all I have is a bson de/serializer and a simple
implementation of the Mongo Wire Protocol. The next logical
step is to write a reasonabl interface so that the user can
interact with the database without worrying about the
underlying protocol. Also, I should add a test suite.
